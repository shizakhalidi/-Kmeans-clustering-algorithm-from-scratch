# -Kmeans-clustering-algorithm-from-scratch
Implementing k-means algorithm to cluster a set of 1000 2D points. 
The data points (x,y) will be generated via Gaussian distribution. 
K-means will take a set of points and the number of clusters (K) and will cluster the points into given number of clusters. The algorithm will stop if there is no significant change coming in positions of centroids.
